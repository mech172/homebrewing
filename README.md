homebrewing calculators
These are calculators in python 3 for making beer. I am a rookie at both programming and homebrewing so feel free to improve upon them and show me what you've done. If you fancy them up in tKinter or some other gui that'd be great, I'd love to learn more about how it was done. Happy brewing and coding!
